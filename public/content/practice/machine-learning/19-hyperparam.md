# Scenario

Which of the following is a **Hyperparameter** (not a Parameter learned during training)?

## Options

- `The weights (coefficients) in Linear Regression.`
- `The split point in a Decision Tree.`
- `The number of trees (n_estimators) in a Random Forest.`
- `The bias term.`

## Correct Answer

```
The number of trees (n_estimators) in a Random Forest.
```

## Explanation

Parameters (weights, bias) are learned from data. Hyperparameters (depth, k, learning rate) are set *before* training by the data scientist.
