# Scenario

What is the main benefit of K-Fold Cross-Validation over a simple Train/Test split?

## Options

- `It runs faster.`
- `It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance by testing on all data chunks.`
- `It eliminates the need for test data.`
- `It automatically tunes hyperparameters.`

## Correct Answer

```
It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance by testing on all data chunks.
```

## Explanation

A single split might be lucky or unlucky. CV repeats the process K times (e.g., 5 folds) and averages the score, giving a robust metric.
