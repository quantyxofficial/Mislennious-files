# Scenario

Why do we split data into Training and Testing sets?

## Options

- `To make the code look complex.`
- `To evaluate the model on unseen data and prevent overfitting.`
- `Because random numbers are fun.`
- `To save memory.`

## Correct Answer

```
To evaluate the model on unseen data and prevent overfitting.
```

## Explanation

If you test on the same questions you studied for, you get 100% but learn nothing. You must test on new data to measure true performance.
