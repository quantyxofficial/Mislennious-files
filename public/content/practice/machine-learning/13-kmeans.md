# Scenario

In K-Means Clustering, what does "K" stand for?

## Options

- `The number of iterations.`
- `The number of clusters you want to find.`
- `The number of features.`
- `The kernel size.`

## Correct Answer

```
The number of clusters you want to find.
```

## Explanation

You must pre-define K (e.g., "Find me 3 groups"). The algorithm then attempts to fit the data into 3 groups.
