# Scenario

In a Fraud Detection model where missing a fraud case is extremely costly, which metric should you maximize?

## Options

- `Precision`
- `Recall`
- `Accuracy`
- `Specificity`

## Correct Answer

```
Recall
```

## Explanation

Recall (Sensitivity) measures "Of all actual fraud cases, how many did we catch?" Maximizing Recall minimizes False Negatives (missed fraud).
