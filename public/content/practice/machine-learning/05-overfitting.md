# Scenario

What is "Overfitting"?

## Options

- `When the model learns the noise/specifics of the training data too well and fails to generalize.`
- `When the model is too simple.`
- `When the model takes too long to train.`
- `When the dataset is too big.`

## Correct Answer

```
When the model learns the noise/specifics of the training data too well and fails to generalize.
```

## Explanation

Overfitting is like memorizing the answers instead of understanding the subject. It performs great on training data but fails on real-world data.
