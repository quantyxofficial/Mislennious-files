# Scenario

Which function allows you to draw an arrow pointing to a specific data point from a text label?

## Options

- `ax.text()`
- `ax.arrow()`
- `ax.annotate()`
- `ax.point_to()`

## Correct Answer

```
ax.annotate()
```

## Explanation

`ax.annotate()` is the most powerful text function. It takes two coordinates: `xy` (the arrow tip) and `xytext` (the text location).
