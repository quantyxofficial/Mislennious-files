# Scenario

Why is the Object-Oriented (OO) interface (`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`) preferred over the Pyplot state interface (`plt.plot()`)?

## Options

- `It is less code.`
- `It is faster.`
- `It handles explicit control over multiple subplots and complex layouts better.`
- `It is newer.`

## Correct Answer

```
It handles explicit control over multiple subplots and complex layouts better.
```

## Explanation

State-based plotting (`plt.plot`) is fine for one graph. But when building a dashboard with 4 graphs, you need to explicitly tell Matplotlib *which* graph (Axes object) you are drawing on.
