# Scenario

What is the primary function of an activation function in a neural network?

## Options

- `To introduce non-linearity`
- `To initialize weights`
- `To calculate the loss`
- `To normalize the input`

## Correct Answer

```
To introduce non-linearity
```

## Explanation

Activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh introduce non-linearity, allowing the neural network to learn complex patterns that linear models cannot.
