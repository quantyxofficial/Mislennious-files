# Scenario

What is the fundamental difference between an RNN and a Feed-Forward Network?

## Options

- `RNNs are deeper.`
- `RNNs have loops (recurrent connections), allowing information to persist.`
- `RNNs use only Sigmoid.`
- `RNNs are for images.`

## Correct Answer

```
RNNs have loops (recurrent connections), allowing information to persist.
```

## Explanation

This loop allows the network to have a "state" or short-term memory, essential for sequences like text or time-series.
