# Scenario

When is Transfer Learning most useful?

## Options

- `When you have a massive dataset.`
- `When you have a small dataset but a similar task was solved on a large dataset.`
- `When you have unlimited computing power.`
- `When you perform Regression.`

## Correct Answer

```
When you have a small dataset but a similar task was solved on a large dataset.
```

## Explanation

You leverage the feature extractors (weights) learned by a big model (e.g., VGG16 on ImageNet) and fine-tune them for your small specific problem.
