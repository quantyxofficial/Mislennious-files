# Scenario

What is Backpropagation?

## Options

- `The process of calculating gradients (derivatives) to determine how to update weights.`
- `Adding layers to the network.`
- `Making a prediction.`
- `Cleaning the data.`

## Correct Answer

```
The process of calculating gradients (derivatives) to determine how to update weights.
```

## Explanation

It propagates the error *backwards* from the output to the input, using the Chain Rule of Calculus to blame specific weights for the mistake.
