# Scenario

What is the main benefit of Max Pooling?

## Options

- `It increases the image resolution.`
- `It reduces the spatial dimensions (size) and computation, while keeping important features.`
- `It adds color.`
- `It replaces the Activation Function.`

## Correct Answer

```
It reduces the spatial dimensions (size) and computation, while keeping important features.
```

## Explanation

It downsamples the image (e.g., from 64x64 to 32x32), making the network lighter and more invariant to small shifts.
