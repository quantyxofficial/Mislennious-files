# Scenario

Why do we use Dropout?

## Options

- `To save battery power.`
- `To prevent Overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.`
- `To speed up the final prediction.`
- `To delete bad data.`

## Correct Answer

```
To prevent Overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
```

## Explanation

It prevents neurons from co-adapting too much. It forces the network to learn robust features that don't rely on a single pathway.
