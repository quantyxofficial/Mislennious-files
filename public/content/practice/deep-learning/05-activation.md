# Scenario

What happens if you remove all Activation Functions from a Neural Network?

## Options

- `It becomes extremely powerful.`
- `It stops working completely.`
- `It becomes just a simple Linear Regression model, no matter how deep it is.`
- `It becomes a Decision Tree.`

## Correct Answer

```
It becomes just a simple Linear Regression model, no matter how deep it is.
```

## Explanation

Activation functions introduce non-linearity. Without them, a stack of linear layers collapses mathematically into a single linear transformation learning only straight lines.
