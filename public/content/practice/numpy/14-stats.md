# Scenario

Which statistical function is less sensitive to extreme outliers?

## Options

- `np.mean()`
- `np.median()`
- `np.std()`
- `np.max()`

## Correct Answer

```
np.median()
```

## Explanation

The mean is pulled heavily by outliers (e.g., one billionaire in a room of students). The median simply picks the middle value, making it "robust".
