# Scenario

You have an array `arr`. How do you check its dimensions (rows, columns)?

## Options

- `arr.size`
- `arr.shape`
- `arr.dim()`
- `arr.length`

## Correct Answer

```
arr.shape
```

## Explanation

`arr.shape` is a property that returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array (e.g., `(3, 4)` for 3 rows, 4 columns). `arr.size` returns total number of elements.
