# Scenario

What is the standard convention for importing NumPy?

## Options

- `import numpy`
- `import numpy as np`
- `from numpy import *`
- `import np`

## Correct Answer

import numpy as np
```

## Explanation

While you *can* import it however you like, `import numpy as np` is the universal standard in the Data Science community. Using anything else makes your code harder for others to read.
