- `Pandas is built into Windows.`
- `Pandas has better spell checking.`

## Correct Answer

```
Pandas can handle millions of rows without crashing and allows for automated, reproducible workflows.
```

## Explanation

Excel starts to lag around 100k rows and crashes near 1M. Pandas (backed by NumPy) can handle millions of rows in memory effortlessly, and scripts can be rerun instantly.
