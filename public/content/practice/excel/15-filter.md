# Scenario

Which shortcut toggles the Filter arrows on/off?

## Options

- `Ctrl + F`
- `Ctrl + Shift + L`
- `Alt + F`
- `Ctrl + T`

## Correct Answer

```
Ctrl + Shift + L
```

## Explanation

Ctrl + Shift + L implies "List" or "filter". It's one of the most useful daily shortcuts. `Ctrl + T` creates a Table (which also adds filters, but is a heavier action).
