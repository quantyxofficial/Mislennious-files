# Scenario

You have "Doe, John" in a single cell. You want "Doe" in one cell and "John" in another. Which tool does this?

## Options

- `Flash Fill`
- `Text to Columns`
- `Split()` function
- `Both Flash Fill and Text to Columns`

## Correct Answer

```
Both Flash Fill and Text to Columns
```

## Explanation

Historically, "Text to Columns" (Data Tab) was the way. Modern Excel adds "Flash Fill" (Ctrl+E) which is even faster. Both are correct strategies.
