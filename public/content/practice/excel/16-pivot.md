# Scenario

You added new rows to your source data, but your Pivot Table still shows the old numbers. What must you do?

## Options

- `Click "Calculate Now" (F9).`
- `Right-click inside the Pivot Table and select "Refresh".`
- `Save and Reopen the file.`
- `Create a new Pivot Table.`

## Correct Answer

```
Right-click inside the Pivot Table and select "Refresh".
```

## Explanation

Pivot Tables store a cache of the data. They do not update live with every cell change (unlike formulas) for performance reasons. You must explicitly Refresh them.
