# Scenario

What character must every Excel formula start with?

## Options

- `$`
- `=`
- `#`
- `+`

## Correct Answer

```
=
```

## Explanation

The equals sign `=` tells Excel "Calculate this". Without it, Excel treats the input as plain text. (Technically `+` works too for legacy Lotus 1-2-3 reasons, but `=` is the standard).
