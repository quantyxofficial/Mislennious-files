### Learn Python

Python is the most popular language in data science. It's beginner-friendly and has powerful libraries for data work.

**Start with:**

- Basic syntax and data types
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modules
- File handling

**Free resources:**

- Python.org official tutorial
- Codecademy Python course
- YouTube channels like Corey Schafer

### Understand Statistics

Statistics is the foundation of data science. You need to understand how data behaves and what it means.

**Key topics:**

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Probability basics
- Distributions
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation and regression

**Learn through:**

- Khan Academy Statistics
- StatQuest YouTube channel
- Your university statistics courses

## Step 2: Learn Essential Libraries

### NumPy

NumPy handles numerical operations efficiently. Learn arrays, mathematical operations, and array manipulation.

### Pandas

Pandas is essential for data manipulation. You'll use it to clean data, handle missing values, and transform datasets.

### Matplotlib and Seaborn

These libraries help you create visualizations. Charts and graphs make your analysis understandable.

**Practice by:**

- Working with real datasets from Kaggle
- Following tutorials on official documentation
- Creating your own mini-projects

## Step 3: Explore Machine Learning
