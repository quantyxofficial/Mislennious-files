## Into the Z-Axis

Sometimes 2D isn't enough. You want to visualize a surface or a 3D trajectory.

### 1. Importing 3D

You must import `Axes3D` (even if you don't use it directly, it registers the '3d' projection).

```python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
# Create a 3D Axis
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
```

### 2. 3D Scatter

```python
xs = [1, 2, 3]
ys = [10, 20, 30]
zs = [0, 5, 0]

ax.scatter(xs, ys, zs, c='r', marker='o')

ax.set_xlabel('X Label')
ax.set_ylabel('Y Label')
ax.set_zlabel('Z Label')
```

### 3. Surface Plots (Advanced)

Plotting a 3D terrain requires `meshgrid`.

```python
X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
Z = np.sin(R)

# Plot Surface
surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis')
```

3D plots are interactive in some notebooks (rotatable), but in static images, choosing the right viewing angle (`ax.view_init(elev, azim)`) is crucial.
