## Teaching Machines to Learn

Traditional Programming: You write Rules + Data = Answers.
Machine Learning: You give Data + Answers = **Rules**.

### The Three Pillars

1.  **Supervised Learning**
    *   You have the "Answer Key" (Labels).
    *   Examples: House Price Prediction, Spam Detection.
    *   Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees.

2.  **Unsupervised Learning**
    *   You have NO labels. The machine must find patterns.
    *   Examples: Customer Segmentation, Anomaly Detection.
    *   Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning**
    *   Learning by trial and error (Reward/Punishment).
    *   Examples: Chess Bots, Self-Driving Cars.

### Scikit-Learn
The industry standard library for classic ML in Python. It provides a consistent interface:
1.  Import
2.  Instantiate
3.  Fit (Train)
4.  Predict
