While classification and regression are the most common tasks, Deep Learning can do much more. This chapter explores the "Generative" side of AI.

## 1. Autoencoders

An Autoencoder is a network that learns to **reconstruct its own input**.
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input into a small "bottleneck" (latent space).
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input from that bottleneck.
- **Primary Use**: Denoising images, anomaly detection (finding fraudulent transactions), and data compression.

## 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

A GAN consists of **two** neural networks competing against each other:
1. **The Generator**: Tries to create "fake" images (e.g., human faces that don't exist).
2. **The Discriminator**: Tries to guess if an image is real or a "fake" created by the Generator.
- Over time, the Generator becomes so good at faking that the Discriminator can no longer tell the difference. This powers much of the "Deepfake" technology today.

## 3. Self-Supervised Learning (The Future)

In supervised learning, we need humans to label millions of images. **Self-Supervised Learning** allows the model to label the data itself.
- For example, a model might hide part of an image and try to "predict" what the missing piece looks like.
- This is how models like GPT were trained—by predicting the "next word" in millions of internet pages without human labels.

## 4. Multimodal Deep Learning

This involves training a model to understand **multiple types of data** at once.
- Example: **CLIP** by OpenAI. It can look at an image and describe it in text, or take text and find a matching image. This "bridge" between different data types is what makes AI feel more human.

## The "Turing Test" of Images
GANs were the first models to routinely pass a visual Turing test, where humans could no longer distinguish between a photograph of a real person and an image generated by an AI!
