## The Digital Brain

Deep Learning mimics the human brain using artificial neurons.

### The Perceptron
The simplest unit (Neuron).
1.  **Inputs (x)**: The data.
2.  **Weights (w)**: The strength of the connection (Learned).
3.  **Bias (b)**: The activation threshold (Learned).
4.  **Output (y)**: The result.

**Formula**: `y = f(w*x + b)`

### Layers
*   **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (pixels).
*   **Hidden Layers**: The "Deep" part. They extract features.
*   **Output Layer**: The final prediction (Cat/Dog).

A network is just massive matrix multiplication optimized by calculus.
