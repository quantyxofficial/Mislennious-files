## The Keyboard Warrior

Speed in Excel comes from refusing to touch the mouse.

### 1. Navigation (The Jump)

*   `Ctrl + Arrow Key`: Jump to the edge of the data region.
    *   If you are at the top and press `Ctrl + Down`, you jump to the last row.
*   `Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Key`: Jump **AND Select** everything in between.
    *   This is how pros select 10,000 rows in 1 second.

### 2. Operations

*   `Ctrl + C` / `Ctrl + V`: Copy / Paste.
*   `Ctrl + Z` / `Ctrl + Y`: Undo / Redo.
*   `F2`: Edit the active cell (Jump inside).
*   `Esc`: Cancel edit (Get me out!).

### 3. The Dollar Sign (`F4`)

When writing formulas, you often need to lock a cell (Absolute Reference).
Instead of typing `$A$1` manually, just type `A1` and hit **`F4`**.
*   1st Press: `$A$1` (Lock Row & Column)
*   2nd Press: `A$1` (Lock Row only)
*   3rd Press: `$A1` (Lock Column only)

### 4. Alt Codes

Press `Alt` once. Letters appear on the Ribbon.
If you press `H`, you go to Home tab. Then `AC` centers text.
Memorize the sequences for your favorite buttons.
