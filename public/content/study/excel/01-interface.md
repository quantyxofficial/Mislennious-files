## Your Cockpit

Excel is not just a grid; it's a cockpit.
To fly fast, you need to know where the buttons are.

### 1. The Ribbon
The top menu is called the **Ribbon**.
*   **Home**: Formatting (Bold, Color, Alignment).
*   **Insert**: PivotTables, Charts, Shapes.
*   **Data**: Sorting, Filtering, Power Query.
*   **View**: Freeze Panes, Zoom.

### 2. The Formula Bar
The long white bar above the grid (`fx`). This is where the truth lives.
A cell might *display* "$500", but the formula bar shows `=SUM(A1:A100)`. Always trust the formula bar.

### 3. The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)
This is the tiny row of icons at the very top-left (above "File").
**Pro Tip**: Customize this! Add your most used buttons (like "Paste Values" or "Freeze Panes") here so you can access them instantly.

### 4. Workbooks vs Worksheets
*   **Workbook**: The file (`.xlsx`).
*   **Worksheet**: The tabs at the bottom ("Sheet1", "Data", "Report").

Keep your workbooks organized. Name your tabs clearly. Color code them (Right Click Tab -> Tab Color).
