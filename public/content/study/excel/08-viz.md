## Visualizing Success

Don't just show numbers. Show insights.

### 1. Conditional Formatting

Color-code your cells based on values.
*   **Data Bars**: Adds a mini bar chart *inside* the cell.
*   **Heat Maps**: Colors high numbers Green, low numbers Red.
*   **Highlight Rules**: "Highlight duplicates" or "Values > 1000".

Use this to make tables scannable.

### 2. Sparklines

Tiny charts that fit in a single cell.
*   Insert -> Sparklines -> Line.
*   Great for showing trends (last 12 months) next to the total.

### 3. Combo Charts

Comparing "Revenue" (Bars, $1M) and "Margin" (Line, 20%).
Since scales are different, you need a **Secondary Axis**.
1.  Insert Combo Chart.
2.  Set Series 2 to "Secondary Axis".

### 4. Chart Hygiene

*   Remove the "Chart Title" if it's obvious.
*   Remove gridlines (or make them faint gray).
*   Sort your bar charts (Biggest to Smallest).
